# Kick Out User
Repo for a [larastream](https://larastream.com) video I did on allowing an admin to force a user to logout of the system.

Another user [made a request](https://larastream.com/requests/logout-specific-user-without-using-session-0) for a video on how to do this, so I figured I'd give it a try. 

You can watch the video [here](https://larastream.com/@GlennKimbleJr/kick-out-an-active-user).

It's a fairly basic implementation. There are a lot of untested edge cases. I didn't even add any permissions or roles or anything to define an "admin."  I just wanted to show the general idea.
